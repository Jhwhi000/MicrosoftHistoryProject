        <p>When talking about the history of computing, there is no way <strong id="strongs">Bill Gates</strong> and his company
            <strong id="strongs">Microsoft</strong> won’t come up in the conversation. If you did'nt know, Bill Gates is a
            Multi-Billion Dollar entrepreneur who has helped shape the way computers have developed over the last
            40 years starting in 1975. Everybody claims they know who <strong id="strongs">Bill Gates</strong> is but do they
            really know how he rose to being one of the richest men in the world and how he developed the software
            that over 1.2 billion people use just their word editing software daily.
        </p>

            In 1975, a loose partnership was formed between Bill Gates and Paul Allen. These two men were computer
            hobbyists and were interested in software design and development(Thompson, 2015). Following this
            partnership, the two convinced the makers of the <strong id="strongs">MITS Altair 8800</strong> to adopt their software. The code
            they used at this time was <strong id="strongs">Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code</strong>
            (or BASIC for short). This helped them gain a better reputation. “Gates and Allen gained better
            reputation and were soon writing programs for other companies.” (Thompson, 2015)
        </p>

        <p>
            The 1980s were huge for Microsoft as they received a deal with <strong id="strongs">IBM</strong> to make the OS for their PC. This
            was called DOS and later on other companies make clones and used <strong id="strongs">MS-DOS</strong>. Later on in the 80s, Microsoft
            released the first edition of Windows operating system. It was the first to allow inputs by a mouse as
            opposed to typing instructions with the correct syntax. It also allowed you to run applications
            simultaneously. This was a revolutionary idea in 1985.” These characteristics made the Windows OS widely
            used in businesses and homes. As a result, Microsoft expanded faster,” (Thompson, 2015). After this,
            Microsoft developed many other programs such as <strong id="strongs">Word</strong> and <strong id="strongs">Excel</strong> which
            could be used by regular people and businesses alike.

            A series of different operating systems came out from Microsoft between 1985-1998. They are as listed
            from oldest to most new; <strong id="strongs">Windows 1.0x, Windows 2.x, Windows 3.0, OS2, Windows 3.1x, Windows NT 3.x,
            Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98</strong>. Following is a table showing the OS Version and release date. </p>

            <p> There wasn’t too much radical difference from generation to
            generation of software, but overall, this 13 years was a vital growing time for the software to become
            as superior as it is today. It went from Windows 1.0x which was an incomplete system that merely helped
            you to navigate the OS with a few special applications, to Windows 98 which was almost like a modern
            computer today, with desktop applications, internet access, and many more features. We might think this
            looks archaic but it is fairly similar to what we are used to.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1998, Microsoft ran into some snafus with the law. They were charged with creating a monopoly
            and had to pay a settlement. This was merely a minor setback.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the turn of the century came around, Microsoft really began diversifying their products. In
            2000 they made the <strong id="strongs">Windows Mobile</strong>, and in 2001 the <strong id="strongs">Xbox</strong> came out. These
            revolutionized both of their own fields. To this day, Microsoft still comes out with revolutionary
            products such as the <strong id="strongs">Surface</strong>, and continues to update their operating software to the top of the line
            for the use of all clients.
